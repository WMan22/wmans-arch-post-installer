# wmans-arch-post-installer
A bookmark to copy and paste of all of the stuff I always install in my arch distros.

A bookmark I'm using until I learn how to make a proper install script. This is meant to be run after you do the initial install for EndeavourOS, Manjaro, or using archinstall on vanilla arch.

Made with KDE Plasma in mind.

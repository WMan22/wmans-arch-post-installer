# wmans-arch-post-installer
A bookmark to copy and paste of all of the stuff I have learned while using arch for myself.

I don't know how to make a proper install script, so I'm using this. This is meant to be consulted after you do the initial install for EndeavourOS, Manjaro, or using archinstall on vanilla arch.

Made with KDE Plasma in mind, but there's a GNOME suggestions entry in case I use that.

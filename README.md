# wmans-arch-post-installer
A bookmark to copy and paste of all of the stuff I always install in my arch distros.

I'm using this until I learn how to make a proper install script. This is meant to be run after you do the initial install for EndeavourOS, Manjaro, or using archinstall on vanilla arch.

Made with KDE Plasma in mind, but there's a GNOME suggestions entry in case I use that.

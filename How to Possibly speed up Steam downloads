HOW TO:

Disclaimer: if you're already getting good speeds, this probably isn't worth doing. If you're seeing speeds capped significantly below what you should be achieving based on speed-testing, this could work for you.

Open steam console in desktop mode (openable with steam://open/console in web browser, or with the command steam steam://open/console in Konsole) and enter in these two commands individually:

@nClientDownloadEnableHTTP2PlatformLinux 0

@fDownloadRateImprovementToAddAnotherConnection 1.0

According to u/Rosentti, the first command disables HTTP 2 which may be the cause of download slowdowns. The other one makes Steam connect to lots more servers (up to 10) which can improve download speeds.

If this works for you, you can automate it (including in Gaming mode) by creating a cfg file in the Steam install directory. On the deck this is in the /home/deck/.steam/steam/ directory. You will need to need to Show Hidden Files in Dolphin to see the .steam directory.

To create the cfg file, open Kate (text editor) and simply copy these lines of code into lines 1 and 2

@nClientDownloadEnableHTTP2PlatformLinux 0

@fDownloadRateImprovementToAddAnotherConnection 1.0

and save as steam_dev.cfg in the /home/deck/.steam/steam/ directory.
